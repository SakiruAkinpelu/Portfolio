![image](HR Analytics Dashboard.png)

This project involved designing and developing an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to support data-driven decision-making within a Human Resources (HR) context.

Understand workforce distribution across roles, departments, and age groups

As part of this project, I applied core data analytics skills including data cleaning, DAX calculations, data modeling, and visualization best practices. The final deliverable is a professional, interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore critical HR metrics through dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities.
