**HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI**

![image](Healthcare Insight Dashboard.png)

This project involved designing and developing an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to support data-driven decision-making within a Human Resources (HR) context. The objective was to analyze employee-related metrics such as attrition, satisfaction, tenure, and performance across various departments and demographic segments.

The dashboard was built using a real-world HR dataset, focusing on transforming raw data into actionable insights that can help HR managers:

Identify high-risk attrition areas

Monitor employee satisfaction trends

Evaluate performance in relation to compensation

Understand workforce distribution across roles, departments, and age groups

As part of this project, I applied core data analytics skills including data cleaning, DAX calculations, data modeling, and visualization best practices. The final deliverable is a professional, interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore critical HR metrics through dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities.
